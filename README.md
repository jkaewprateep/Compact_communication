# Compact_communication
Compact communication messages to examples of pulse modulation in communication devices, the pulse codes may related to the environment and there are many controller or joystick message wrappers hanldes of the input into the PyGame environment over serials or discrete messages as a binary or numeric value reference.

<b> 🧸💬 For incompatible PLE or joystick libraries for a duration of time playing games will cause no response feedback action of the player because the reference number is close but not exactly the same and they are conversion between numeric and discrete when discrete serial is not fully supported or not support by the newer versions of games as serial does it before. </b></br>
🐑💬 ➰ It is simply a wide method at the time of using the multiplexer to divide messages and compare the response for the actions, the multiplexer is a very fast calculation with a summing function and it can perform multiple requests at the same time since a single multiplexer uses can perform at 4 inputs at a time. </br>

### 🧸💬 The 5 player actions versus 12 monster actions with pulse modulation

🐨🎁🎵🎶 The leading numbers communication is natural encryption because there are multiple levels of communication level ```understanding```, ```compatibility```, and ```user experiences```. The summation method used in the validation method can tell you quickly about what is the signals communicating and you can describe in detail and respond to feedback. ```High contrast number``` is the operating system or active code running such as ```SOS``` and ```FOD``` . </br>

```
player 5 actions, monsters 12 actions

input =   [ 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0 ]    # 🧸💬 Sequence action of player 
monster = [ 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3 ]    # 🧸💬 Sequence action of monster

input =   [ 0, 0][1, 1, 1][2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2][1, 1, 1][4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4][3, 3, 3][1, 1, 1][0, 0 ]    # 🧸💬 Gropping action of player
monster = [ 0, 0][2, 2][4][1, 1, 1][3, 3][0, 0][2, 2][4][1, 1, 1][3, 3][0, 0][2, 2][4][1, 1, 1][3, 3 ]    # 🧸💬 Gropping action of monster

# 👧💬 🎈 You can tell it easy monster does not care about the player's moves.

### 🧸💬 Mapping method

🐐💬 In simple communications compression mapping messages with target codes or multiplexers for usage sequence order is a simple method for data communication message compression. That is ```direct message compression``` or ```lossless compression```, not the ```lossless attenuation``` as in the famous series movie. In communication signals, the property is the ability to create ```unique communication messages``` from multiple original messages with data cyclic controls, and ```data validation```, and ```data recovery```. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ In business requirements they are finding a method for creating messages that can only be read by the message generator and the target message to responses. There are multiple sharing methods as ```symmetric message communications encryptions ``` and ```message substitution```, this method is fast but it requires securing both sides of the transmitter and receiver's stronghold of the secret keys and/or the method for reading and understanding the communication message and response and ```asymmetric encryption``` method. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 In data communications signals communication property there is another we are talking about is pulse code modulation because signal message extraction can be performed in multiple levels and the accuracy of message extraction from the original message varies by the ```method```, ```compatibilities```, and ```user experiences```. Commercials can create message advertising with larger target group members with smaller group members having accurate messages or hidden messages. Some natural language and added into this message behavior to ``` assist people``` such as no connected sequence digits in keypad position or contrast numbers and alphanumeric commands to respond to multi-purpose assist people. 💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 No command from same row keypad input ```2,3``` but ```2,6``` as example 😎💬 🎵🎶 . </br>
🦭💬 ```Home``` and ```End```assignments are powerful buttons when we haven't used these commands ```Page Up``` and ```Page Down``` they assist people to find break points in digital e-books or start reading from paragraph. 😎💬 🎵🎶 . </br>
🦤💬 Encryption algorithms do not mean only creating secret messages for fooling people but they can be used for natural language communication design. </br>
