# Compact_communication
Compact communication messages to examples of pulse modulation in communication devices, the pulse codes may related to the environment and there are many controller or joystick message wrappers hanldes of the input into the PyGame environment over serials or discrete messages as a binary or numeric value reference.

<b> 🧸💬 For incompatible PLE or joystick libraries for a duration of time playing games will cause no response feedback action of the player because the reference number is close but not exactly the same and they are conversion between numeric and discrete when discrete serial is not fully supported or not support by the newer versions of games as serial does it before. </b></br>
🐑💬 ➰ It is simply a wide method at the time of using the multiplexer to divide messages and compare the response for the actions, the multiplexer is a very fast calculation with a summing function and it can perform multiple requests at the same time since a single multiplexer uses can perform at 4 inputs at a time. </br>

### 🧸💬 The 5 player actions versus 12 monster actions with pulse modulation

🐨🎁🎵🎶 The leading numbers communication is natural encryption because there are multiple levels of communication level ```understanding```, ```compatibility```, and ```user experiences```. The summation method used in the validation method can tell you quickly about what is the signals communicating and you can describe in detail and respond to feedback. ```High contrast number``` is the operating system or active code running such as ```SOS``` and ```FOD``` . </br>

```
player 5 actions, monsters 12 actions

input =   [ 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0 ]    # 🧸💬 Sequence action of player 
monster = [ 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3 ]    # 🧸💬 Sequence action of monster

input =   [ 0, 0][1, 1, 1][2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2][1, 1, 1][4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4][3, 3, 3][1, 1, 1][0, 0 ]    # 🧸💬 Gropping action of player
monster = [ 0, 0][2, 2][4][1, 1, 1][3, 3][0, 0][2, 2][4][1, 1, 1][3, 3][0, 0][2, 2][4][1, 1, 1][3, 3 ]    # 🧸💬 Gropping action of monster

# 👧💬 🎈 You can tell it easy monster does not care about the player's moves.
```

👧💬 🎈 When communication bandwidths are narrowed and we need to create more actions than its design, someone shows up and talks about data variance in pulse code modulation or prismns. 👨🏻‍🏫 </br>
👨🏻‍🏫💬 In the white lights noise backgrounds carrier we see they are composed of many lights and the meaning of existing information they can contain. </br>

### 🧸💬 Mapping method

🐐💬 In simple communications compression mapping messages with target codes or multiplexers for usage sequence order is a simple method for data communication message compression. That is ```direct message compression``` or ```lossless compression```, not the ```lossless attenuation``` as in the famous series movie. In communication signals, the property is the ability to create ```unique communication messages``` from multiple original messages with data cyclic controls, and ```data validation```, and ```data recovery```. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ In business requirements they are finding a method for creating messages that can only be read by the message generator and the target message to responses. There are multiple sharing methods as ```symmetric message communications encryptions ``` and ```message substitution```, this method is fast but it requires securing both sides of the transmitter and receiver's stronghold of the secret keys and/or the method for reading and understanding the communication message and response and ```asymmetric encryption``` method. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 In data communications signals communication property there is another we are talking about is pulse code modulation because signal message extraction can be performed in multiple levels and the accuracy of message extraction from the original message varies by the ```method```, ```compatibilities```, and ```user experiences```. Commercials can create message advertising with larger target group members with smaller group members having accurate messages or hidden messages. Some natural language and added into this message behavior to ``` assist people``` such as no connected sequence digits in keypad position or contrast numbers and alphanumeric commands to respond to multi-purpose assist people. 💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 No command from same row keypad input ```2,3``` but ```2,6``` as example 😎💬 🎵🎶 . </br>
🦭💬 ```Home``` and ```End```assignments are powerful buttons when we haven't used these commands ```Page Up``` and ```Page Down``` they assist people to find break points in digital e-books or start reading from paragraph. 😎💬 🎵🎶 . </br>
🦤💬 Encryption algorithms do not mean only creating secret messages for fooling people but they can be used for natural language communication design. </br>

#### 🧸💬 Data dictionary

🐑💬 ➰ Starting from this idea programming and relationship conditions are hard to find by most people, we can build a machine to find some relationship from inputs for simple tasks such as ```do``` and ```don't``` actions. </br>
🧸💬 We found these features in tools or utilities, how can you use a guide to find dangerous ```movement in the pathway``` or ```suddenly change of step level``` or ```friend animals help feeder?``` </br>
🐐💬 There are many function buttons on the keyboard, the designer understands and assists people by adding space between sets of buttons not to save on the manufacturing costs but they be able to use of setup function in the future. 🐐💬 Fewer people ask this kinds of question today because it does not flash and has adaptive features. </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 The ```scroll lock``` button tells you they are reading and do not skip the line meaning exists, in the attached picture prohibited actions detection. </br>

#### 🧸💬 Usage of dictionary items and property than tuple or list

🐑💬 ➰ The reason for using a data ```dictionary``` more often is we can read the value from the ```target attribute``` key by word understanding and meaning as we can create when we define these attributes. </br>
🦤💬 Go back into the past more than 10 years when scientists and developers tried to create word sentiment and natural language processing methods to assist the command input by humans and they found there were too many numbers and variables to handle when performing the method development. One way is to define readable variables we can manage and one method is using a data dictionary, inside of the speech synthesis engine, they can read from the ```dictionary key items``` and ```key item values``` . </br>
💃( 👩‍🏫 )💬 The ```autograph``` and ```pin button barcodes``` initially created not to prevent of thief but to assist people about authorize of people and businesses see their technology benefits, ```autograph``` may help with signing and text reading assistance also ```pin button barcodes``` for identification helper. </br>

```
dic_image = { "still" : PLAYER_ST_PIC, "left" : PLAYER_LF_PIC, "left2" : PLAYER_L2_PIC, "right" : PLAYER_RT_PIC, "right2" : PLAYER_R2_PIC }

dic_monster = { "right" : MONSTER_01, "left" : MONSTER_02, "right2" : MONSTER_03, "right3" : MONSTER_04, "right4" : MONSTER_05, "left3" : MONSTER_06,
		"left4" : MONSTER_07, "left5" : MONSTER_08, "left6" : MONSTER_09, "still1" : MONSTER_10, "still2" : MONSTER_11, "still3" : MONSTER_12 }
```

#### 🧸💬 Correct response action possibilities

🦭💬 The application idea is the select ```the most frequent action that occurs``` and ```actions to respond``` to support the action given, multiplexer or multiplication can tell which actions are ```most likely to occur``` at the time this is the level of the target remote device implementer by embedded logic. </br>
👧💬 🎈 And it is reverse in contrast aggressive mode, we have a set of actions in the waiting list and find the time occurrence matching of both sequences initiation. ```{ right 1, 2, 3, 4, left 1, 2, 3, 4 }``` </br>

```
conditions 	1 -> { 1, 2, 4 } ==> 3 / 12 == 0.250
		2 -> { 1, 2, 3 } ==> 3 / 12 == 0.250
		3 -> { 2, 4 }    ==> 2 / 12 == 0.167
		4 -> { 0, 1, 3 } ==> 3 / 12 == 0.250
		...

conditions  	[1, 1, 1] -> [2, 2][4]
		[3, 3, 3] -> [2, 2][4]
```

### 🧸💬 Mapping method - sequence

🥺💬 Scale up a bit to find the alignment of two input sequences or time domain data transformation from ```[2, 2][4][1, 1, 1][3, 3][0, 0]``` to ```|------------ 0 -------------|``` . </br>
🧸💬 The same series in response to the same sales domain, or different domain compressed 29 bytes to 1 byte. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ Eventually, compressed 29 bytes of data to 3 or more bytes, there are more space for integration devices. </br>

```
		[2, 2][4][1, 1, 1][3, 3][0, 0][2, 2][4][1, 1, 1][3, 3][0, 0][2, 2][4][1, 1, 1][3, 3]
		|------------ 0 -------------||------------ 1 -------------||------------ 2 -------------|
		|------------------------------------------ 1 -------------------------------------------|
			
A		['0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1']
